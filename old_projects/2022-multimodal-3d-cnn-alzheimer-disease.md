# Aim
Classify Alzehiemr disease using multiple modailites like MRI, PET scan, EHR and genomic data all together, to use their complimentary information


# Progress so far
 - [x] Build pipeline and train unimodal 3D CNN (MRI and PET) with 50 million and more parameters to create unimodal baseline.
 - [x] Train DL models for Late fusion baseline
 - [x] Train DL model for early fusion baseline
