CNNs based classification of skin lesions

Github page - https://github.com/Amritpal-001/DermaAI

## Aim
deploying deep learning models for Derma diagnosis


## Goals - 
- [x] Train models
- [x] Test models
- [x] Python based GUI framework to deploy model
- [ ] Prediction probabilities
- [ ] Choosing model function - Multiple models for different diseases
- [ ] Image augmentation before making prediction
- [ ] Model optimisation
- [ ] Model Pruining
- [ ] GradCAM for explainability of model
