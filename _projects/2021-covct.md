Overview: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Uncounted people around the world got affected due to this virus. Various articles have reported that COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases have very few distinct features. We aim to develop an AI-based Android Application, which will distinguish COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases using computed tomography (CT) images.

Present Status of the work: A classification architecture using TensorFlow has been developed using Python. It works on Linux, Mac, and Windows systems.

Deliverables: The student will work on the development of an AI-based android application. The students may explore the idea of federated learning techniques on Android phones.
