##### Description:

In this competition, youâ€™ll detect and delineate distinct objects of interest in biological images depicting neuronal cell types commonly used in the study of neurological disorders. More specifically, you'll use phase contrast microscopy images to train and test your model for instance segmentation of neuronal cells. Successful models will do this with a high level of accuracy.
