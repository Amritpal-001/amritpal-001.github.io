Robotic surgery has increased the domain of surgeries possible. Several examples of partial surgical automation have been seen in the past decade. We break down the path of automation tasks into features required and provide a checklist that can help reach higher levels of surgical automation. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and advances required to make this happen.
