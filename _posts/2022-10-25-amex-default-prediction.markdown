## Introduction/Background
With credit-based spending dominating modern consumer behavior and 70% of Americans using a credit card regularly for payments [5], it is critical for credit issuers to assess the risk of their practice to minimize the impact of credit defaulting and ensure greater sustainability of borrowing and lending in the long term. Manual assessment of financial statements and direct calculation of default probability with models like the Merton model is widely leveraged today by lenders. However, these methods are often too generic to capture credit risk at the correct level of granularity and make oversimplifying assumptions that lead to error during risk assessment. 

## Problem Definition
Decision trees, clustering models, and logistical regression are used today to predict credit defaulting based on data that maps consumer demographic and spending data to the credit risk of lending. These models rely on an unmanageably large variety of features and could continue to improve in accuracy. Our AMEX dataset contains features describing spending, payment, balance, and risk-informative measures for AMEX customers across a sample 18-month period, and the target variable is the probability of the customer's most recent credit card statement being defaulted. The goal of this project is to further explore machine learning techniques for more accurate credit default risk prediction based on a relatively small but effective feature set.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
### Data Collection
We obtain the data set from the [AMEX Default Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/overview) competition on Kaggle. According to the official competition site, the data contains profile features for each customer at the statement date. All features have been anonymized, normalized, and fall into these categories:
